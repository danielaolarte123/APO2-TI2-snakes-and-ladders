# Snakes and ladders - Integrative Task 2

This functional program reflects the functionality of a console game.

## Tools:
* Java software.
* Eclipse.

## Participants:
* Daniela Olarte
* Santiago Gutierrez

## Objective: 

This game consist on navigating your piece from start to finish, avoid the snakes, and take shortcuts going up the ladders. The players will move their pieces from left to right, starting at 1, following the numbers on the board, then the next row from right to left and repeat in a table that is given by the user (n x m). If a player rolls a 4, then the player would move their piece four places. The program has an internal dice which works automatically after typing a line break. The user is also in charge of providing the number of snakes and ladders, however, they will be placed in the game board randomly.

In that sense of ideas, when a player lands on a top of a snake, their playing piece will slide down to the bottom of the snake and when a player lands at the base of a ladder, it immediately climbs to the top of the ladder. 

The first player that reaches the highest space on the board, wins the game and the program will show the name or nickname of the winner as well as its score. 

In addition, you can find all documentation of this game [here](https://github.com/danielaolarte123/TI2-snakes-and-ladders/tree/main/docs).
